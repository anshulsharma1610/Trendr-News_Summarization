 ### Project Description: Trendr

This project is a news application that allows users to create an account and log in with a unique username and password. Users can then set and change their preferences for news categories and sources.
The news feed displays news summaries based on the user's preferences. Additionally, the application shows top tweets based on the user's news preference and top news headlines in the trending section irrespective of their preferences.
Users can like, comment, and share news articles and also save/bookmark articles for later reading. The application also allows users to search for news articles by keywords and categories and translate articles into other languages.
In terms of subscription management, users can enroll and manage their app subscription. Paid subscribers can be viewed by the admin.
The admin features include the ability to add news articles to the website, manage users, view analytics dashboard, and add other admins. Moderation features include the ability for moderators to delete comments and block users.
The analytics dashboard provides insights on website traffic and user behavior, which can be used to make data-driven decisions.
This news application provides a comprehensive news experience for users while offering powerful management tools for the admin.
